OpenGlExperimentation
=====================

Experimenting with tools and utils for shape generation and OpenGL drawing.

This used to be my support project while I was developing a library which
would generat NURBS surfaces.

It includes tons of utils upon utils, upon mistaken usage of the C++ language.
It was my big learning project, the one that led me to discover the real
nature of c++, software engineering and openGl.

It is really far away from being usable in any way, and it can hardly provide
any reference or trick of significant value. It consists mostly of random
experimentations for the proper use of the language.

Hidden among these, there is some wisdom stored, concerning the use of OpenGl and
its quirks.

There are also some pretty basic but actually useful mathematical algorithms and
shape generators (vertices).
